# Survival Analysis on Veteran Dataset

⏳ Survival Analysis on Veteran Dataset This project explores survival analysis techniques on the Veteran dataset using lifelines. It includes Kaplan-Meier estimation, Log-Rank test, Cox Proportional Hazards model, and Time-Varying Cox models.

🚀 Key Features

Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves by Treatment Group

Log-Rank Test to compare survival distributions

Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) Model

Time-Varying Cox Regression

Median survival estimation

Visualizations using Matplotlib

🧠 Statistical Concepts

Kaplan-Meier Estimator: Non-parametric survival function

Log-Rank Test: Tests equality of survival curves

CoxPH Model: Estimates hazard ratios

Time-Varying Cox: Allows changing covariates over time

P-Value: Significance of covariates

Hazard Ratio: Impact of features on event probability
